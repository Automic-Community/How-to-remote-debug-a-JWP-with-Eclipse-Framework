Documenation and Instructions
---

<p><span>After upgrading our Automic AE from V10 to V12 we had the problem that the JWP couldn&rsquo;t build the search index due to an object with a faulty XML documentation. Unfortunately the error message in the JWP log didn&rsquo;t had any information which object caused the index builder to crash. So we had to debug the JWP and see which object is processed when the error is happening.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
